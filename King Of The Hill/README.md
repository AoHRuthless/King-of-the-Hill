<h3>About</h3>
The existence of King of the Hill is meant to simulate the popular combative experience of the minigame within the confines of Minecraft. 

The objective of the minigame is to control a small location, referred to as the hill. The goal of players is to assert their dominance of the hill 
by slaying all enemies that attempt to enter. Players are equally divided into two teams: red and blue. To score points, one team must have more 
players in the constantly rotating hill than the other team. The winning team is the one that scores the most points in a specified time limit, or 
the first team to reach a predetermined score.
