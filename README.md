Welcome to the GitHub source for the Bukkit Plugin King of the Hill.

King of the Hill is a minecraft plugin designed to resemble the popular King of the Hill combative experience. The objective of this game is to control a small location known as the hill. The hill is a rotating area which cycles through configurable locations. Both red and blue teams try to assert dominance of the hill to score points. The first team to reach a certain score wins.
